#  Indian Currency Classification using CNN (ResNet-18)

## 1. Introduction

Indian currency recognition is a practical computer vision problem with real-world applications such as:
- Automated cash handling systems
- Assistive technology for visually impaired users
- Banking and financial automation
- Fraud detection and verification systems

This project implements an **end-to-end deep learning pipeline** to classify **Indian currency denominations** from images using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** based on **ResNet-18** with transfer learning.

The project is designed with **clean architecture, proper evaluation, and generalization in mind**, making it suitable for learning, portfolios, and interviews.

## 2. Problem Statement

Given an image of an Indian currency note, the system should:
- Correctly identify the **denomination of the currency**
- Generalize well to unseen images
- Avoid overfitting
- Provide reliable evaluation on validation and test data

---

## 3. Supported Currency Denominations

The model classifies the following **7 Indian currency denominations**:

- ₹10  
- ₹20  
- ₹50  
- ₹100  
- ₹200  
- ₹500  
- ₹2000  

---

## 4. Dataset Description

- The dataset consists of labeled images of Indian currency notes.
- Images are divided into **training**, **validation**, and **test** sets.
- CSV files store image paths and labels.
- Raw images are intentionally **not included in the repository** due to size constraints.

### Dataset Splits
- Train set: Used to train the model
- Validation set: Used to monitor overfitting and tune performance
- Test set: Used for final evaluation

> Only CSV split files are committed to GitHub to keep the repository lightweight.

## 5. Label Encoding Strategy

Currency labels are encoded internally to work with PyTorch’s loss functions.

| Denomination | Encoded Label |
|-------------|---------------|
| ₹10  | 0 |
| ₹20  | 1 |
| ₹50  | 2 |
| ₹100 | 3 |
| ₹200 | 4 |
| ₹500 | 5 |
| ₹2000 | 6 |

This encoding is handled inside the Dataset class, keeping CSV files human-readable.

## 6. Model Architecture

### Base Model
- **ResNet-18**
- Pretrained on **ImageNet**
- Uses residual connections to avoid vanishing gradients

### Transfer Learning
- Pretrained weights are reused
- Final fully connected layer is replaced with a custom classifier

### Custom Classification Head
- Dropout (p = 0.5)
- Fully connected layer with 7 outputs

### Why ResNet-18?
- Lightweight and fast
- Strong performance on small to medium datasets
- Less prone to overfitting than deeper variants
- Widely used in industry and research

## 7. Training Configuration

- Epochs: **15**
- Batch size: **32**
- Optimizer: **Adam**
- Learning rate: **0.00005**
- Loss function: **CrossEntropyLoss**
- Regularization:
  - Dropout
  - Weight decay (L2 regularization)

Training logs include:
- Epoch number
- Training loss and accuracy
- Validation loss and accuracy

---

## 8. Overfitting Prevention

Several strategies were used to prevent overfitting:
- Transfer learning instead of training from scratch
- Dropout to prevent neuron co-adaptation
- Weight decay to control large weights
- Validation-based monitoring
- Early stopping readiness (optional extension)

The final model shows minimal gap between training and validation accuracy.

---

## 9. Model Evaluation

The trained model is evaluated on a **held-out test dataset** to measure real generalization.

Evaluation metrics include:
- Overall test accuracy
- Precision per class
- Recall per class
- F1-score per class
- Macro and weighted averages

This ensures balanced performance across all denominations.

## 10. Inference Pipeline

The inference pipeline:
1. Loads the trained model
2. Applies the same preprocessing used during training
3. Runs a forward pass
4. Returns the predicted denomination

Example usage:
```python
from src.inference.predict import load_model, predict_currency

model = load_model("best_currency_model.pth")
result = predict_currency("sample_image.jpg", model)
print(result)
```
